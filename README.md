## Noteify

# What is Noteify?

Noteify, pronounced Notify, is a note-taking web application that lets users create notes for tasks throughout their day and allow them to have sufficient time-management and organization skills for their daily-life. Noteify is built utilising the MERN stack as it's quick, efficient, flexible, and has a wide range of community support.

## Where is Noteify in its development process?

Noteify is currently still under-development and would be classed as an early-alpha based project. Small amounts of features have been implemented currently, but the project will continue to scale as time passes by. The backend API is currently being developed before the frontend UI is in development. Testing API endpoints through software like Postman will also take place to ensure that features are working as intended.
